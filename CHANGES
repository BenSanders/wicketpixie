WICKETPIXIE CHANGELOG

WORKING - TBA, 2009
 * FEATURE: The Custom Code feature allows you to add custom code to
 header.php and footer.php without modifying the template yourself.
 * FEATURE: Adsense Integration allows you insert Adsense ads in the
 recommended areas without touching the templates.
 * PLUGIN: Numerous plugins have been added:
 All-in-one SEO pack, Auto-hyperlink URLs, DISQUS, FAlbum, Kontera,
 Obfuscate Email, and StatPress Reloaded
 * PLUGIN: Updated Related Posts plugin to version 1.0.
 * ADDED: WicketPixie has it's own top-level menu in WordPress' admin area.
 There is also a top-level menu for the plugins bundled with WicketPixie.
 * PERFORMANCE: We are using Google to serve jQuery and favicons, so page load
 times will have decreased.
 * PERFORMANCE: Status update caching caches the latest feed item from the
 designated source for status updates. If the cache is older than 45 seconds,
 a new cache is built.
 * UPDATED: Twitter post will show "from WicketPixie" now after you publish
 a blog post and have Twitter set to be notified by WicketPixie.
 * UPDATED: @{username here} in status updates will now link to that user's
 Twitter profile, if Twitter is set to provide the updates of course.
 * UPDATED: Made the search highlight plugin optional.
 * FIXED: Checkboxes in WicketPixie Options will remember their settings.
 * FIXED: Nofollow has been added to header and navigational links for better
 SEO.
 * FIXED: Appended UNIX timestamp to the end of CSS files to prevent caching.

 * FEATURE: Plain-text URLs in the Status Updates box are now hyperlinked,
 now only one click is required for visitors.
 * FEATURE: WicketPixie Services Notification System. Basically, when a
 user publishes a blog post, Ping.fm or Twitter, depending on what the
 user setup, is notified and a link to that blog post is sent out.
 * FIXED: Fixed a few CSS issues

v1.0.3 - January 7, 2009 by Eddie Ringle

 has been either automated or moved into the theme folder,
 making things much easier on the user.

 version of WicketPixie.
 * PERFORMANCE: More UI improvements, now the all the admin pages WicketPixie
 adds load much faster and do not halt in the middle of loading.
 * UPDATED: Updated SimplePie version.

v1.0.2 - January 4, 2009 by Eddie Ringle
 * FEATURE: UI improvements to certain WicketPixie forms. For example,
 if a source has no feed associated, it will show "N/A" on the
 Sources Manager page. Also, you can't flush non-feed streams,
 so the buttons to flush them have been removed.
 * UPDATED: Updated Source Manager and Faves Manager for Wordpress 2.7+
 as well as leaving it backwards compatible with Wordpress 2.5+
