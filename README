INSTALLING

Just place the wicketpixie folder in your /wp-content/themes/ directory and
then activate the theme. Then make sure the httpd user has write access to
the widgets folder and it's contents (chmod -R a+rwx) and the app folder
(chmod a+rwx). Remember, if your web server uses the same user that owns
the wicketpixie files, there is no need to change permissions.
