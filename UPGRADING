UPGRADING WICKETPIXIE

If you are upgrading from WicketPixie 1.0.1 or 1.0, you'll need to delete the
WicketPixie plugins from /wp-content/plugins/ and also delete the
/wp-content/uploads/activity/ folder. You will not have to do this with any
version of WicketPixie newer than 1.0.1.

Upgrading to WicketPixie 1.1:

As of WicketPixie 1.1, options will be stored in files instead of the WordPress
database. You _WILL_ lose your settings, so write them down before upgrading.
Don't worry, Sources and Faves are safe. ;-)

To upgrade, just copy the wicketpixie directory to wp-content/themes,
overwriting the old wicketpixie directory. After that, you're done.
