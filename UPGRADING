UPGRADING WICKETPIXIE

If you are upgrading from WicketPixie 1.0.1 or 1.0, you'll need to delete the
WicketPixie plugins from /wp-content/plugins/ and also delete the
/wp-content/uploads/activity/ folder. You will not have to do this with any
version of WicketPixie newer than 1.0.1.

Upgrading to WicketPixie 1.2+:

As of WicketPixie 1.2, major code changes will break the widgets for your
Social Mes (or Sources). To fix them, click on 'Regenerate Widgets' in
the WicketPixie Social Me Manager.
