UPGRADING WICKETPIXIE

If you are upgrading from WicketPixie 1.0.1 or 1.0, you'll need to delete the
WicketPixie plugins from /wp-content/plugins/ and also delete the
/wp-content/uploads/activity/ folder. You will not have to do this with any
version of WicketPixie newer than 1.0.1.

As of WicketPixie 1.1, you no longer need to modify header.php to add in any
extra code, thanks to the new Custom Header feature. Just be sure to save any
custom code you had in header.php so you can add it to the Custom Header admin
page.
